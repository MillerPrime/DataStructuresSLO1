# Data Structures - SLO #1

## What it does
This program uses Java's PriorityQueue and HashSet to compare two sets of names.  
It shows:
- The union (all names from both sets, no duplicates)
- The difference (names in the first set but not the second)
- The intersection (names that appear in both sets)

## How to run it
1. Open the project in your Java IDE.
2. Compile the `Miller_SLO1.java` file.
3. Run the program.
4. The results will print in the console.
